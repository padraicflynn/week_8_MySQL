Note for the grader:
Because of the way I was backing up and uploading homework assignments to GitHub I had trouble pushing week 8 into the week 7 repo. It was easier to make a new repo add the updates here. I will use this repo moving forward and push changes we make in the coming weeks.  


"# week_8_MySQL" 
This is the progress we've made since week 7. We've created commands to add and drop tables. We also have a cool ERD!
